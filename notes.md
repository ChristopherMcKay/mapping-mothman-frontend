### Witness identified only by the initials "TH"
#### 2018 Dec 26
#### Muncie, Indiana

Described a sighting near Muncie, Indiana, just south of the Prairie Creek Reservoir. Muncie is just about halfway between Point Pleasant, West Virgina and Chicago, Illinois. According to TH, the sighting occurred on December 26, 2018. he and his wife were driving on U.S. 35 when he saw a “huge winged humanoid” fly overhead. 

TH is a military veteran, hunter, trapper and farmer who lives in the immediate area. His knowledge of military flying craft, wildlife and his keen sense of observance was apparent while I talked to him. The winged being that he was observing was unlike anything he had ever seen before. The creature was flying just above treetop level and was easily visible to the witness. His reaction was to slam on his brakes in wonderment, exclaiming to his wife ‘do you see that?’ His wife was shaken by the sudden stop and was unable to react fast enough to see the winged being.   TH stated that the being was humanoid in shape with an obvious ‘face.’ The body had a length of approximately 6-7 feet, with bat-like wings that were extremely wide. The being was dark-colored, and seemed to glide at a steady speed. He never noticed the flapping of wings while watching the creature.

#### 1966 Nov 15
#### Point Pleasant, West Virginia

One night, the group was driving past the West Virginia Ordnance Works, located about seven miles north of Point Pleasant, when they noticed two red lights near the factory gate. They stopped the car to investigate and discovered that the lights were actually the glowing eyes of a "large animal, shaped like a man, but bigger, maybe six and a half or seven feet tall, with big wings folded against its back," according Linda Scarberry in an eyewitness account detailed at Mothman Museum. The creature chased the group at speeds of over 100 miles per hour toward Route 62.

The following night, the creature was seen by Mrs. Marcella Bennett and then again on November 24 by four more people. On November 25, the Mothman was seen standing in a field when it suddenly spread its wings and flew away. On January 11, 1967, the Mothman was seen hovering around the Point Pleasant Bridge, also called the Silver Bridge. On and off throughout that year, more reports were filed about sightings of the creature around the bridge. Finally, on December 15, 1967, the bridge collapsed and killed 46 people.
